# 8 Puzzle Problem

## Problem Statement
The 8 puzzle problem consists of a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to move the tiles around until they are arranged in a specific order, typically with the numbers in ascending order and the empty space in the bottom-right corner.

## Algorithm
The most common algorithms used to solve the 8 puzzle problem include:
- A* Search Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the A* algorithm is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution. In the worst case, the time complexity can be exponential.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the A* algorithm is also O(b^d) due to the storage of nodes in memory. This can be a significant drawback for large search spaces.
